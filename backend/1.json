Add cumin seeds, chopped onions, ginger, garlic and sauté until onions turn golden brown. Step 2: Add chopped tomatoes, green chili, cashews, and all dry spices (turmeric, coriander powder, red chili powder, garam masala). Cook until tomatoes become soft. Step 3: Let the mixture cool slightly, then blend it into a smooth paste using little water. Step 4: In the same pan, add 1 tbsp butter again and pour in the prepared paste. Cook on medium flame for 8–10 minutes until oil starts separating. Step 5: Add a little sugar and salt to balance flavors. Crush kasuri methi between your palms and add for aroma. Step 6: Add ½ cup fresh cream and stir well to make a rich, smooth gravy. Step 7: Now add paneer cubes and gently mix so they coat with the gravy. Let it simmer on low heat for 5 minutes so paneer absorbs the flavors. Step 8: Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and a swirl of cream. Step 9: Serve hot with butter naan, roti, or jeera rice."
